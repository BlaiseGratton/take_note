# Take Note

I'm building this project to learn how to make a simple CRUD application using Flask with Peewee. 
Flask is a 'microframework' for Python, and Peewee is a small ORM built by (coleifer)[http://github.com/coleifer/peewee].

The end goal is to have a user login, create new notes, view all their notes, or search notes by category, date created, or substring.
